# Carbonara 

## Takeaways

As I am just beginning to learn Typescript I felt more comfortable creating my own React app and building out the feature with only React. 
I built out 3 components that could be reusable in the future along with 3 css files unique for each component. 
I simulated fetching data from the back-end by using a constructor with "dummy-data". 
Some challenges I ran into were configuring the flex boxes. My bootcamp primarily focused on functionality and not on styling, 
however I can see myself getting really good. I look forward to cruising through a Udemy course so I can solidify best styling practices
and the intricacies of how css works. All in all, I hope that I can continue my journey with Carbonara as this kind of work excites me. 
Again, I realize that I might be going up against candidates that have experience, but I'm ready to put in the work and
believe I will be an asset to the team!
